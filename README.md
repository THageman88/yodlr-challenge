# Yodlr Full Stack Code/Design Challenge: React Frontend and Express Backend

Hello!

Welcome to our Full Stack Code Challenge using React and Express. This challenge allows us to evaluate your skills in a more real-world setting, just as you would when creating applications in a professional environment. 

We are excited about this challenge as it uses two powerful technologies - React, a robust library for building user interfaces, and Express, a minimalist web application framework for Node.js. The decision to pair these technologies as opposed to utilizing vanilla JavaScript is due to a number of factors.

## Why React and Express?

**1. Efficiency:** React allows for the creation of reusable UI components, which promotes consistency across the application, saves development time, and reduces the amount of code.

**2. Flexibility:** React and Express are both unopinionated libraries, meaning they offer more flexibility and control to developers over custom configurations.

**3. Performance:** React's virtual DOM offers a more efficient method of updating and rendering components in the browser, improving the application's performance.

**4. Scalability:** Both React and Express are designed with scalability in mind, making them ideal for applications that need to handle high levels of traffic or grow over time.

**5. Community Support:** Both technologies have large communities, ensuring a wealth of resources, support, and pre-built solutions to common problems.

## Getting Started

Below you will find instructions on how to get both the frontend and backend up and running.

### Installation and Running the Back-end Express Server

1. Download and install [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/).

2. Download this source code:
   *fork this repository and git clone your fork

3. Navigate to the top-level directory of this source tree and install the package dependencies by running the following command:


4. Start the application server by running: npm start

You can access the start page (index.html) by opening your browser to [http://localhost:3000].

5. To stop the server, press CTRL-C.

### Installation and Running the React Front-end

1. Navigate to the React application directory in a separate terminal.

2. Install the package dependencies by running the following command: npm install

3. Run by using the command: npm start

If you followed all these commands everything should be up and running!
